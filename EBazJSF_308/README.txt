This is a starting skeleton for a JSF lab in CS545, March 2008.  The skeleton
is mostly operational for the browse and select use case.  It uses stub data
from a mock product subsystem.  The browse and select use case controller
is implemented for the happy day use case flow.  The rest of the skeleton runs 
with hard-wired data.

There are a set of unit tests included.  Most of the tests are working, but there
are 3 tests that fail and 2 with errors.
